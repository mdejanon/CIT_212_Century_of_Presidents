            <p>During his presidency, George Washington established many foundational aspects of the federal government.

            <p>In foreign affairs, he maintained neutrality during the French Revolutionary Wars and secured important treaties, such as the Jay Treaty with Great Britain. He chose not to seek a third term and delivered a Farewell Address in 1796, warning against political parties and foreign alliances. His leadership laid the foundation for the United States’ future governance.</p>
