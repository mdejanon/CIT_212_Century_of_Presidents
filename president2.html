            <p>Abraham Lincoln is best known for his leadership during the Civil War and his efforts to abolish slavery. He issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, declaring that all slaves in Confederate states were to be set free. This pivotal action changed the character of the war and paved the way for the eventual abolition of slavery in the United States. Lincoln’s dedication to preserving the Union and navigating the nation through its most challenging period cemented his legacy as one of America’s greatest presidents.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In addition to his work on emancipation, Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address in 1863, a brief but powerful speech that redefined the purpose of the war and emphasized liberty and equality. His leadership was instrumental in passing the 13th Amendment, which officially abolished slavery in the United States.</p>
